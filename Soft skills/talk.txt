Ad in india is a huge buisness industries spend a lot on thier advertisments 

you ccan see during a IND vs PAk cricket match the broadcaster even befoe the last ball id bowled  bamm thers a adds n add 

weather we like it or not add influence our decision now a days there is a speperate profession called add content writer there workis just to make their 
creative 
5 to 8 years a ago we used to wait for electric bill go to banglore one or keb office pay the bills now we use google pay even before thenext month has startd
we get a notification that pay your current bill 

we used to use paytm or bank websites to pay credit card bills now we use cred why beacuse of their crazy innovative advertisments

bk and mcd they usd one slogan for hiring and as advertisment "Why work for a clown when you can be a king" this sentance completerly chnaged thier sales 
everyone were talking about this and thus a brand was set in your mind and you started going there

We Indians are adicted to one brand policy we dont change our brand till we or the brand dies eg nestel maggi 

suppose your given 4 sweatshirts of the same color but on one of the sweatshirt abidas is written nd addidas is written on the other we will
of course choose the adidas one because brand is Important without brand its like wearing plain paper 

of course there are ppl who dont see brands and just see the price tag and the is wen we are matured and that dosent come easily 
its not like we choose to choose brands rule our lives it jyst happnned  

so i conclude by saying that yes indeed brands rule our lives and no doubt adds play a huge role in influencing our decision but now that we have 
just started earning we will have to start small and slowey let us rule and choose  the brands
