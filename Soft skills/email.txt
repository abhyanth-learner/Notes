Subject:- Payment due for order no-#12DF45

Hello Mr. Malhotra,

You are a valuable customer for our company for a long time. You have always been on-time with regards to payment but recently,
you had placed a ordered with us and the payment is still due. We have a policy of 2 months credit period, but that time has lapsed.
I would request you to complete the payment at the earliest for the goods delivered. We will be looking forward to the payment and 
maintaining our longstanding relationship with our company. 

Thanks and regards,
Sameer.
